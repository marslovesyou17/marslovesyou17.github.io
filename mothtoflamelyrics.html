	<h1>~ "moth to flame" Lyrics ~</h1>
	<br>
	<h3>moth to flame</h3>
	<p>I am to you as<br>
a moth is to flame<br>
You are too beautiful<br>
But hurt me just the same<br>
You shine to me with ephemerality<br>
Before I get burned and you leave<br>
Loving you seems to be self harm<br>
You left me wingless, only with my arms<br><br>

You burn up my wings when they touch you<br>
You light up my night when it's past curfew<br>
I just can't help myself, love is my virtue<br>
You say I'm pressuring you, that's so true<br>
Only in your head where delusion is the truth<br>
Mine is the same but the delusion is loving you<br>
I wanna say "fuck this fire" and get out<br>
But now I'm too tired to move around<br><br>

Spaces we shared<br>
Beds, baths, and food<br>
Your warmth ensnared<br>
My body, mind, and mood<br><br>

You burn up my wings when they touch you<br>
You light up my night when it's past curfew<br>
I just can't help myself, love is my virtue<br>
You say I'm pressuring you, that's so true<br>
Only in your head where delusion is the truth<br>
Mine is the same but the delusion is loving you<br>
I wanna say "fuck this fire" and get out<br>
But now I'm too tired to move around<br><br>

I could blow out the flame but I don't want to<br>
I could crawl away but I can't<br>
You want to keep me around, don't you?<br>
It's burning me to ash and sand<br><br>

You burn up my wings when they touch you<br>
You light up my night when it's past curfew<br>
I just can't help myself, love is my virtue<br>
You say I'm pressuring you, that's so true<br>
Only in your head where delusion is the truth<br>
Mine is the same but the delusion is loving you<br>
I wanna say "fuck this fire" and get out<br>
But now I'm too tired to move around<br><br>

(You burn up my wings)<br>
(You burn them)<br>
(You burn them)
