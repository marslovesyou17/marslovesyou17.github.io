	<p>On the "first date" he came to my house<br>
We watched a movie but not on the couch<br>
He stole my first kiss like he was a poser<br>
Then in a month it was pretty much over<br><br>

A text for a breakup, it gave me no closure<br><br>

Went to a park for a first and last date<br>
I showed up first and he showed up late<br>
We went on a hike nearby<br>
He talked the whole time<br><br>

He kissed me with tongue and then said goodbye<br><br>

New boy at a new park, and it was great<br>
Best I could've asked for, like it was fate<br>
First guy I said "I love you" to<br>
But 50 days gone, I had no clue<br><br>

He ghosted that summer, and colored me blue<br><br>

Like a morning fog, new boy blinded me<br>
Couple of red flags I chose not to see<br>
Loved him for 3 months and still love him now<br>
Trying to stay friends but I don't know how<br><br>

But I need him in my life, so I'll let myself drown<br>

	<p>I am to you as<br>
a moth is to flame<br>
You are too beautiful<br>
But hurt me just the same<br>
You shine to me with ephemerality<br>
Before I get burned and you leave<br>
Loving you seems to be self harm<br>
You left me wingless, only with my arms<br><br>

You burn up my wings when they touch you<br>
You light up my night when it's past curfew<br>
I just can't help myself, love is my virtue<br>
You say I'm pressuring you, that's so true<br>
Only in your head where delusion is the truth<br>
Mine is the same but the delusion is loving you<br>
I wanna say "fuck this fire" and get out<br>
But now I'm too tired to move around<br><br>

Spaces we shared<br>
Beds, baths, and food<br>
Your warmth ensnared<br>
My body, mind, and mood<br><br>

You burn up my wings when they touch you<br>
You light up my night when it's past curfew<br>
I just can't help myself, love is my virtue<br>
You say I'm pressuring you, that's so true<br>
Only in your head where delusion is the truth<br>
Mine is the same but the delusion is loving you<br>
I wanna say "fuck this fire" and get out<br>
But now I'm too tired to move around<br><br>

I could blow out the flame but I don't want to<br>
I could crawl away but I can't<br>
You want to keep me around, don't you?<br>
It's burning me to ash and sand<br><br>

You burn up my wings when they touch you<br>
You light up my night when it's past curfew<br>
I just can't help myself, love is my virtue<br>
You say I'm pressuring you, that's so true<br>
Only in your head where delusion is the truth<br>
Mine is the same but the delusion is loving you<br>
I wanna say "fuck this fire" and get out<br>
But now I'm too tired to move around<br><br>

(You burn up my wings)<br>
(You burn them)<br>
(You burn them)

	<p>Your towel's hanging near<br>
For when you'd shower here<br>
A reminder of what we shared<br>
I wonder if you even care<br>
Even though I saw you cry<br>
And I saw it in your eyes<br>
You care about me too<br>
But I never trust the truth<br><br>

Tell me you love me<br>
Say that you miss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and kiss me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and fix everything<br><br>

When I was your sweetheart<br>
I felt like we were pure art<br>
But now maybe we weren't<br>
Now I feel I've learned<br>
We always had trouble growing<br>
Through all of the weeds<br>
You said you wouldn't be going<br>
But I don't know where this leads<br><br>

Tell me you love me<br>
Say that you miss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and kiss me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and<br><br>

Tell me you miss me<br>
Say that you'll kiss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and love me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and fix everything<br><br>

The lightning and the rain came down<br>
On our flowers in this small town<br>
All the gifts on earth can't fix my heart<br>
But I still want nothing to tear us apart<br><br>

Tell me you love me<br>
Say that you miss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and kiss me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and<br><br>

Tell me you miss me<br>
Say that you'll kiss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and love me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and fix everything

	<p>I used to believe<br>
That karma's real<br>
But after all this<br>
That's not how I feel<br>
How can I believe<br>
That justice gets served<br>
When the villains get their way?<br>
They don't get what they deserve<br><br>

Good things always happen to bad people<br>
I wish it wasn't true<br>
Bad things always happen to good people<br>
So what the hell can I do?<br><br>

I used to believe<br>
That karma's real<br>
But after all this<br>
That's not how I feel<br>
How can I trust<br>
That good things come<br>
When the suffering never ends?<br>
I'd rather just be numb<br><br>

Good things always happen to bad people<br>
I wish it wasn't true<br>
Bad things always happen to good people<br>
So what the hell can I do?<br><br>
		
Bad things always happen to good people<br>
So what the hell can I do?<br><br>

Good things always happen to bad people<br>
I wish it wasn't true<br>
Bad things always happen to good people<br>
So what the hell can I do?<br><br>

Karma sounds nice <br>
The idea does entice<br>
If only it were real<br>
That's how I feel</p>

	<p>What's the fun<br>
In every body being shallow?<br>
I'm so done<br>
With everybody staying callow<br>
<br>
Oh I can't take<br>
A paperweight<br>
To be a mate<br>
It's just so fake <br>
<br>
Don't want a flake<br>
For god's sake<br>
If you're gonna talk to me only when you're wanting fun<br>
I don't wanna be the one<br>
<br>
Why don't many people wanna know me?<br>
Why don't many people wanna care?<br>
Not just stay around to enjoy my comedy<br>
I've got so much love to share<br>
<br>
Oh I can't take<br>
A paperweight<br>
To be a mate<br>
It's just so fake <br>
<br>
Don't want a flake<br>
For god's sake<br>
If you're gonna talk to me only when you're wanting fun<br>
Don't want the jokes<br>
If you're gonna choke<br>
When I come to you for comfort, and you only ever run<br>
I don't wanna be the one<br>
<br>
I don't wanna be the one, one<br>
I don't wanna be the one, one<br>
If you're gonna talk to me only when you're wanting fun<br>
I don't wanna be the one</p>

	<p>I am my mother's child
I try to fix everyone's shit
If a man comes to my life
I fear he'll leave in a fit
My brother always stole the spotlight
Inhaled all the air in the dining room
He's the mess so I must be the best
it's sending me an air of doom

I try I try I try
To be the favorite child
I make sandcastles from gravel
Exhausted, I unravel
I cry I cry I cry
Because of the war in my mind
I try my best, but I'm reviled
I die to be the favorite child

I'm the only grandchild left now 
I've gotta help out but the voices are loud
My problems aren't visible to the naked eye
Except when the salt comes out and I cry
I've got some obsessions
I need to leave good impressions
It feels like I fail every time 
Makes me wonder why, but I still try

I try I try I try
To be the favorite child
I make sandcastles from gravel
Exhausted, I unravel
I cry I cry I cry
Because of the war in my mind
I try my best, but I'm reviled
I die to be the favorite child

Never had a strong father figure
So many men strike my trigger
They come and they go
I run and I hit low
I'm so tired of trying
To keep the family together
I fail and I'm dying
Got temperamental weather
I will never be the favorite
A tale so old, it's fucking ancient
I will never be enough for anyone
The expectations can't be outdone
		
I try I try I try
To be the favorite child
I make sandcastles from gravel
Exhausted, I unravel
I cry I cry I cry
Because of the war in my mind
I try my best, but I'm reviled
I die to be the favorite child</p>

	<p>I'll bring a poppy to the stone<br>
On a windy day my hair will be blown<br>
I'll shed a single tear for us<br>
And later I could toast to a lack of trust<br><br>

I wish that I could hate you<br>
But that's something I'd never do<br>
So in the night when I lie alone in bed<br>
I cry myself to sleep and dream of poppy red <br><br>

(Poppy red)<br>
(Poppy red)<br><br>

Red was only meaning for the color in my eyes<br>
I am only grieving the bond we had as it dies<br>
Left the flower on our grave as a bright red<br>
One day I'll return and see my poppy dead

I miss you<br>
I'd wait for you<br><br>

I fell for you<br>
Then hit the cold ground<br>
You didn't catch me<br>
Scraped up my body<br>
Stumbled on my roses <br>
Then planted more seeds<br>
Water them one day<br>
Then step on them like weeds<br>
If I'm a cloud, I'm pouring<br>
When you step on the plants<br>
Tryna water them with my tears<br>
And you're stuck in a trance<br>
<br>
I cry for you<br>
I cry for us<br>
I cry at dawn<br>
I cry at dusk<br>
<br>
I'm in the deep<br>
I'm in the dark<br>
I can't sleep<br>
With my broken heart<br>

Tell me what you want for us<br>
Tell me why I never trust<br>
You<br>

I'm all dried out<br>
I cried for us<br>
I'm all tired out<br>
I think I'm dust<br>

	<p>Sometimes I think we could've had it all<br>
I rarely think about your lack of balls<br>
But when there's a moment that I just do<br>
I feel I could've made a life with you<br>
If you really were at all brave like me<br>
Our ship would have sailed beautifully<br>
Like a thorn it's stabbing, stabbing to me<br>
It's a painful reminder to me, see?<br><br>
 
I ignore the thorn in my side<br>
I try not to adorn our past life<br>
It could've not given us the blues<br>
But the one who broke my heart is you<br><br>

Trying not to get cut in the bushes <br>
Fucking crying face down in my cushions<br>
Blood is racing down my face and body<br>
I'm missing you at my birthday party<br>
Cause a year ago you spent the night here<br>
Kinda wish a guy like you would appear<br>
Puberty has been a fucking prison<br>
Wish I could lock problems in a prism<br><br>

I ignore the thorn in my side<br>
I try not to adorn our past life<br>
It could've not given us the blues<br>
But the one who broke my trust is you<br><br>

I ignore the thorn in my side<br>
I try not to adorn our past life<br>
It could've been our future too<br>
But the one who bailed on us is you</p>

	<p>You picked the cherries from my tree<br>
You showed such a salacious need<br>
You didn't care how it affected me<br>
You pushed and pushed aggressively<br>
Your pressure melted me like wax<br>
You erased logic, feigned facts<br>
Self control's what your brain lacks<br>
Now thinking back, I can't relax<br>
<br>
Your ghost is after me<br>
You ruined me effectively<br>
The vines have wrapped around my waist<br>
It gives me such a bitter taste<br>
Why am I so cynical?<br>
Why are you so physical?<br>
Future lovers, please just nurture<br>
The victim of the usurper<br>
<br>
uh oh uh oh<br>
uh oh uh oh<br>
<br>
Immature is no excuse<br>
Not when you made me feel used<br>
You harvested, and then abused<br>
The resources that I gave you<br>
I'm mother nature, you're a man<br>
Used my beach to help you tan<br>
Said you promise to replant<br>
Two weeks later, no you can't<br>
<br>
Your ghost is after me<br>
You ruined me effectively<br>
The vines have wrapped around my waist<br>

	<p>My eyes send burning signals to my mind<br>
When I see what I need all the time<br>
But I want to not need to be fed<br>
Despite knowing I'd end up dead<br>
<br>
(Go further, get thinner)<br>
(Skip lunch, skip dinner)<br>
(Don't fucking touch that)<br>
(You're being a brat)<br>
<br>
It wants me to be empty<br>
The mirror's lying to me<br>
All my thoughts are stones<br>
Let me show my bones<br>
<br>
I have to not show my bones<br>
<br>
I hide my meals in shame from every eye<br>
When I am asked if I'm hungry I just lie<br>
Nobody will believe me cause I look fine<br>
Lately my mind feels like it isn't mine<br>
		<br>
(Every bite makes you look much worse)<br>
(Look pretty even if you end up in a hearse)<br>
(Suck it in until it stays, I'll tear your soul apart)<br>

It wants me to be empty<br>

All the food<br>
Has expired<br>
I wanna shrink away<br>
It's too hard to stay<br>
Here in my brain<br>
My body brings me pain<br>
Just give me a break<br>
Just give me a break<br>
It's more than I can take<br>
It's more than I can take<br>
<br>
It wants me to be empty<br>
The mirror's lying to me<br>
All my thoughts are stones<br>
Let (make) me show my bones<br>
It wants me to be empty<br>
The mirror's lying to me<br>
All my thoughts are stones<br>
I can't show my bones<br>

I have to not show my bones

Morsels of memories sit on my plate<br>
It was gone too soon<br>
You were my ephemeral everything<br>
Hope I'm over it by June<br>
Hope it's in a better place now<br>
Instead of where we were<br>
Hope I feel better somehow<br>
I beg to find a cure<br>
<br>
White fluorescent hallways<br>
But I want someone to love me always<br>
<br>
Knitted white blanket over us<br>
Watching films on week nights<br>
But what's comfort if there's no trust?<br>
I'm tired of delusional fights<br>
Loving you's hell, so we must be there<br>
Almost bleeding from the pain<br>
Left my tears streaming for hours, I swear<br>
You're immature, and now I'm insane<br>
<br>
White fluorescent hallways<br>
But I want someone to love me always<br>
<br>
I wanna trust you<br>
But the countless empty promises tell me no<br>
I can't fucking fix you<br>
You're kind and rude and smart and dumb and so<br>
I’ll let it stay buried<br>
I won’t dig it up<br>
But I’ll grieve it<br>
Goodbye to this love<br>
<br>
Goodbye, goodbye<br>
Goodbye to this love<br>
Goodbye, goodbye<br>
Goodbye to this love<br>
<br>
Morsels of memories sit on my plate<br>
It was gone too soon<br>
You were my ephemeral everything<br>
Hope I'm over it by June

	<p>I've heard your dirty talk<br>
You've held me in bed<br>
We've had to look at the clock<br>
We'd go shower like you said<br>
We've been up close and personal<br>
In several different places<br>
I'd say the rest but it's a mouthful<br>
I'd see yours in a crowd of faces<br>
<br>
It's hard to hang with you now that we're friends<br>
Cause I have seen you with no pants or shirt on<br>
It's hard to hear "what's up" when we've slept in the same bed<br>
Cause I have missed awaking next to you at dawn <br>
Though it pains me all the time to be friends<br>
And how it hurts when I just want to pretend<br>
But I need you in my world still<br>
I just need some time to heal
<br>and then I will<br>
<br>
We've seen each other nude<br>
Fogging your glasses making out<br>
Now you're just another dude<br>
But the flashbacks are far too loud<br>
<br>
It's hard to hang with you now that we're friends<br>
Cause I have seen you with no pants or shirt on<br>
It's hard to hear "what's up?" when we've slept in the same bed<br>
Cause I have missed awaking next to you at dawn <br>
Though it pains me all the time to be friends<br>
And how it hurts when I just want to pretend<br>
But I need you in my world still<br>
I just need some time to heal
<br>and then I will<br>
<br>
Good and bad, you have affected me, it's sad<br>
Times we had, I'm too depressed to be mad<br>
Every time, my mind just takes a dive<br>
In our life, takes out files from our archive<br>
I can't put them away<br>
I can't put them away<br>
<br>
(Away) It's hard to hang with you now that we're friends<br>
Cause I have seen you with no pants or shirt on<br>
It's hard to hear "what's up?" when we've slept in the same bed<br>
Cause I have missed awaking next to you at dawn <br>
Though it pains me all the time to be friends<br>
And how it hurts when I just want to pretend<br>
But I need you in my world still<br>
I just need some time to heal
<br>and then I will</p>

	<h3 id="boyfriend">boy friend</h3>
	<p>I forgive you for the harm you caused<br>
You made it up to me when we paused<br>
Being friends with an ex is crazy<br>
But it just takes work, no being lazy<br>
<br>
I know you're holding your breath<br>
But this song won't cause you death<br>
<br>
I'm not angry anymore<br>
Took a half a year but I'm closing that door<br>
You might be a bad boyfriend<br>
But hey that doesn't mean that I want us to end<br>
I'm not angry anymore<br>
Only took some tears but hey, I love you to my core<br>
It was pretty hard to mend<br>
But hey, you're doing way better as a normal friend<br>
<br>
I forgive you for the stupid fights<br>
Self righteousness thinking you were right<br>
Everyone makes mistakes in college<br>
Staying friends wasn't one, I acknowledge <br>
<br>
I know you're holding your breath<br>
But this song won't cause you death<br>
<br>
I'm not angry anymore<br>
Took a half a year, but I'm closing that door<br>
You might be a bad boyfriend<br>
But hey that doesn't mean that I want us to end<br>
I'm not angry anymore<br>
Only took some tears but hey, I love you to my core<br>
It was pretty hard to mend<br>
But hey, you're doing way better as a normal friend<br>
<br>
I love you so much<br>
Just don't ever touch<br>
Me below the waist again<br>
My time is precious, don't waste it <br>
Maybe one day when we are old<br>
If you've changed, then don't be cold<br>
If nothing else has worked out then<br>
We could try again, but until then, we should just be friends<br>
<br>
I'm not angry anymore<br>
Took a half a year, but I'm closing that door<br>
You might be a bad boyfriend<br>
But hey that doesn't mean that I want us to end<br>
I'm not angry anymore<br>
Only took some tears but hey, I love you to my core<br>
It was pretty hard to mend<br>
But hey, you're doing way better as a normal friend</p>

	<h3 id="exit">EXIT</h3>
	<p>I wish people noticed when I leave the room<br>
I wish people acted like they care if I'm in a tomb<br>
Freaking out, staying proud<br>
Voices loud, too much doubt<br>
There's always someone better<br>
So my eyes always get redder<br>
I just fold<br>
I'm so cold<br>
<br>
I can't go on<br>
All my motivation's gone<br>
The world's gone to shit <br>
In hell, we'll all be lit<br>
I don't belong here<br>
I don't belong anywhere<br>
I'm so cold<br>
Where is the exit?<br>
<br>
I'm dizzy, head is foggy<br>
I'm tired, brain is soggy<br>
Guess two salads isn't enough<br>
Being alive is way too rough<br>
Pocket knives, hiding red lines<br>
On my thighs, must serve me right<br>
Corsets, salads, measure tape<br>
Binging, starving, I gain weight<br>
All ruined my teenage hood <br>
All I tried to be was good<br>
<br>
I can't go on<br>
All my motivation's gone<br>
The world's gone to shit <br>
In hell, we'll all be lit<br>
I don't belong here<br>
I don't belong anywhere<br>
I'm so cold<br>
Where is the exit?<br>
<br>
I'm alone most of the time<br>
My presence worth only a dime<br>
I wish people noticed when I leave the room<br>
So I go<br>
Where?<br>
Where is the exit?<br>
I need the exit<br>
Where is my exit?<br>
Where where where where?<br>
Where where where where?<br>
<br>
I can't go on<br>
All my motivation's gone<br>
The world's gone to shit <br>
In hell, we'll all be lit<br>
<br>
I don't belong here<br>
I don't belong anywhere<br>
I'm so cold<br>
Where is the exit?</p>
