	<p>On the "first date" he came to my house<br>
We watched a movie but not on the couch<br>
He stole my first kiss like he was a poser<br>
Then in a month it was pretty much over<br><br>

A text for a breakup, it gave me no closure<br><br>

Went to a park for a first and last date<br>
I showed up first and he showed up late<br>
We went on a hike nearby<br>
He talked the whole time<br><br>

He kissed me with tongue and then said goodbye<br><br>

New boy at a new park, and it was great<br>
Best I could've asked for, like it was fate<br>
First guy I said "I love you" to<br>
But 50 days gone, I had no clue<br><br>

He ghosted that summer, and colored me blue<br><br>

Like a morning fog, new boy blinded me<br>
Couple of red flags I chose not to see<br>
Loved him for 3 months and still love him now<br>
Trying to stay friends but I don't know how<br><br>

But I need him in my life, so I'll let myself drown<br>

	<p>I am to you as<br>
a moth is to flame<br>
You are too beautiful<br>
But hurt me just the same<br>
You shine to me with ephemerality<br>
Before I get burned and you leave<br>
Loving you seems to be self harm<br>
You left me wingless, only with my arms<br><br>

You burn up my wings when they touch you<br>
You light up my night when it's past curfew<br>
I just can't help myself, love is my virtue<br>
You say I'm pressuring you, that's so true<br>
Only in your head where delusion is the truth<br>
Mine is the same but the delusion is loving you<br>
I wanna say "fuck this fire" and get out<br>
But now I'm too tired to move around<br><br>

Spaces we shared<br>
Beds, baths, and food<br>
Your warmth ensnared<br>
My body, mind, and mood<br><br>

You burn up my wings when they touch you<br>
You light up my night when it's past curfew<br>
I just can't help myself, love is my virtue<br>
You say I'm pressuring you, that's so true<br>
Only in your head where delusion is the truth<br>
Mine is the same but the delusion is loving you<br>
I wanna say "fuck this fire" and get out<br>
But now I'm too tired to move around<br><br>

I could blow out the flame but I don't want to<br>
I could crawl away but I can't<br>
You want to keep me around, don't you?<br>
It's burning me to ash and sand<br><br>

You burn up my wings when they touch you<br>
You light up my night when it's past curfew<br>
I just can't help myself, love is my virtue<br>
You say I'm pressuring you, that's so true<br>
Only in your head where delusion is the truth<br>
Mine is the same but the delusion is loving you<br>
I wanna say "fuck this fire" and get out<br>
But now I'm too tired to move around<br><br>

(You burn up my wings)<br>
(You burn them)<br>
(You burn them)

	<p>Your towel's hanging near<br>
For when you'd shower here<br>
A reminder of what we shared<br>
I wonder if you even care<br>
Even though I saw you cry<br>
And I saw it in your eyes<br>
You care about me too<br>
But I never trust the truth<br><br>

Tell me you love me<br>
Say that you miss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and kiss me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and fix everything<br><br>

When I was your sweetheart<br>
I felt like we were pure art<br>
But now maybe we weren't<br>
Now I feel I've learned<br>
We always had trouble growing<br>
Through all of the weeds<br>
You said you wouldn't be going<br>
But I don't know where this leads<br><br>

Tell me you love me<br>
Say that you miss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and kiss me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and<br><br>

Tell me you miss me<br>
Say that you'll kiss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and love me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and fix everything<br><br>

The lightning and the rain came down<br>
On our flowers in this small town<br>
All the gifts on earth can't fix my heart<br>
But I still want nothing to tear us apart<br><br>

Tell me you love me<br>
Say that you miss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and kiss me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and<br><br>

Tell me you miss me<br>
Say that you'll kiss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and love me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and fix everything

	<p>I used to believe<br>
That karma's real<br>
But after all this<br>
That's not how I feel<br>
How can I believe<br>
That justice gets served<br>
When the villains get their way?<br>
They don't get what they deserve<br><br>

Good things always happen to bad people<br>
I wish it wasn't true<br>
Bad things always happen to good people<br>
So what the hell can I do?<br><br>

I used to believe<br>
That karma's real<br>
But after all this<br>
That's not how I feel<br>
How can I trust<br>
That good things come<br>
When the suffering never ends?<br>
I'd rather just be numb<br><br>

Good things always happen to bad people<br>
I wish it wasn't true<br>
Bad things always happen to good people<br>
So what the hell can I do?<br><br>
		
Bad things always happen to good people<br>
So what the hell can I do?<br><br>

Good things always happen to bad people<br>
I wish it wasn't true<br>
Bad things always happen to good people<br>
So what the hell can I do?<br><br>

Karma sounds nice <br>
The idea does entice<br>
If only it were real<br>
That's how I feel</p>

	<p>What's the fun
In every body being shallow?
I'm so done
With everybody staying callow

Oh I can't take
A paperweight
To be a mate
It's just so fake 

Don't want a flake
For god's sake
If you're gonna talk to me only when you're wanting fun
I don't wanna be the one

Why don't many people wanna know me?
Why don't many people wanna care?
Not just stay around to enjoy my comedy
I've got so much love to share

Oh I can't take
A paperweight
To be a mate
It's just so fake 

Don't want a flake
For god's sake
If you're gonna talk to me only when you're wanting fun
I don't wanna be the one
Don't want the jokes
If you're gonna choke
When I come to you for comfort, and you only ever run
I don't wanna be the one

I don't wanna be the one, one
I don't wanna be the one, one
If you're gonna talk to me only when you're wanting fun
I don't wanna be the one</p>

	<p>I am my mother's child
I try to fix everyone's shit
If a man comes to my life
I fear he'll leave in a fit
My brother always stole the spotlight
Inhaled all the air in the dining room
He's the mess so I must be the best
it's sending me an air of doom

I try I try I try
To be the favorite child
I make sandcastles from gravel
Exhausted, I unravel
I cry I cry I cry
Because of the war in my mind
I try my best, but I'm reviled
I die to be the favorite child

I'm the only grandchild left now 
I've gotta help out but the voices are loud
My problems aren't visible to the naked eye
Except when the salt comes out and I cry
I've got some obsessions
I need to leave good impressions
It feels like I fail every time 
Makes me wonder why, but I still try

I try I try I try
To be the favorite child
I make sandcastles from gravel
Exhausted, I unravel
I cry I cry I cry
Because of the war in my mind
I try my best, but I'm reviled
I die to be the favorite child

Never had a strong father figure
So many men strike my trigger
They come and they go
I run and I hit low
I'm so tired of trying
To keep the family together
I fail and I'm dying
Got temperamental weather
I will never be the favorite
A tale so old, it's fucking ancient
I will never be enough for anyone
The expectations can't be outdone
		
I try I try I try
To be the favorite child
I make sandcastles from gravel
Exhausted, I unravel
I cry I cry I cry
Because of the war in my mind
I try my best, but I'm reviled
I die to be the favorite child</p>

	<p>I'll bring a poppy to the stone<br>
On a windy day my hair will be blown<br>
I'll shed a single tear for us<br>
And later I could toast to a lack of trust<br><br>

I wish that I could hate you<br>
But that's something I'd never do<br>
So in the night when I lie alone in bed<br>
I cry myself to sleep and dream of poppy red <br><br>

(Poppy red)<br>
(Poppy red)<br><br>

Red was only meaning for the color in my eyes<br>
I am only grieving the bond we had as it dies<br>
Left the flower on our grave as a bright red<br>
One day I'll return and see my poppy dead

	<p>I miss you<br>
I miss you<br>
I miss you<br>
I'd wait for you<br><br>

I fell for you<br>
Then hit the cold ground<br>
You didn't catch me<br>
Scraped up my body<br>
Stumbled on my roses <br>
Then planted more seeds<br>
Water them one day<br>
Then step on them like weeds<br>
If I'm a cloud, I'm pouring<br>
When you step on the plants<br>
Tryna water them with my tears<br>
And you're stuck in a trance<br>
<br>
I cry for you<br>
I cry for us<br>
I cry at dawn<br>
I cry at dusk<br>
<br>
I'm in the deep<br>
I'm in the dark<br>
I can't sleep<br>
With my broken heart<br>
<br>
Tell me what you want for us<br>
Tell me why I never trust<br>
You<br>
		<br>
I'm all dried out<br>
I cried for us<br>
I'm all tired out<br>
I think I'm dust<br>

You turned back<br>
You turned back<br>
You turned back</p>

	<p>I love you<br>
You don't love me <br>
As much as I do<br>
Set me free<br><br>

The second<br>
Option<br>
In every <br>
Situation<br><br>

Nobody loves me as much as I love them<br><br>

Always just<br>
The unimportant friend<br>
My knife rusts<br>
But still I feel like shit in the end<br><br>

A friend<br>
Is hanging out<br>
With people
They barely know over me<br><br>

Nobody loves me as much as I love them<br><br>

Maybe I'll stop being clingy <br>
And give them their space<br>
Won't express the extent <br>
Of my love if it's a waste<br><br>

Nobody loves me as much as I love them<br>
It's simple as that, no need to pretend<br><br>


PART II: <br><br>
 
Nobody can satisfy me<br>
Are my standards too high? <br>
Or does everyone just suck? <br>
I may never know! <br><br>

Quit fucking disappointing me<br>
I loved you and you couldn't see<br>
I thought you cared for me<br>
Have you listened to "nightshade"? Well I guess we'll see <br><br>

Nobody loves me as much as I love them<br>
It's simple as that, no need to pretend<br>
I'm going crazy, this torture never ends<br>
Lie all you want, but I know that you'll miss this<br><br>

Think about someone else's feelings for a change<br>
Think about someone else's feelings for a change<br>
Think about someone else's feelings for a change<br>
I'd give you one more chance but people never change<br><br>

Nobody hates me as much as I hate them<br>
It's simple as that, no need to pretend<br>
I'm going crazy, this torture never ends<br>
Lie all you want, but I know that you'll miss this<br><br>
 
People never change<br>
People never change<br>
People never change no<br>
People never change<br><br>

People never change<br>
People never change<br>
People never change no<br>
People never change<br><br>

People never change<br>
People never change<br>
People never fucking change</p>

	<h3 id="wshtm">what society has taught me</h3>
	<p>People will tell you to speak<br>
Then ignore you when you do<br>
They'll act like you're a freak<br>
Then act like they belong in a zoo<br><br>

They say "stand up for yourself"<br>
Then call you fucking sensitive<br>
They'll put you on the highest shelf<br>
Then ask why you're so negative<br><br>

Why's everybody a hypocrite?<br>
Abusive love, I don't give a shit<br>
What you are going through<br>
Cause I'm going through my own shit too<br><br>

People will ask you why<br>
Then get mad at the reason<br>
People will always lie<br>
In every goddamn season<br><br>

They say "just go make friends"<br>
Gee, why haven't I thought of that?<br>
They say "Oh he just tends<br>
To be a dickwad and a rat"<br><br>

Why's everybody a hypocrite?<br>
Abusive love, I don't give a shit<br>
What you are going through<br>
Cause I'm going through my own shit too<br><br>

They'll excuse the worst people<br>
Then ask what they did wrong <br>
They'll push you to your limit <br>
Then act like you were the villain all along <br>

Why's everybody a hypocrite?<br>
Abusive love, I don't give a shit<br>
What you are going through<br>
Cause I'm going through my own shit too<br><br>

This is what society has taught me<br>
Everyone's an asshole, wimp or hypocrite<br>
Of it all I can't ever be free<br>
Fuck you all, I wish I could just quit</p>

	<p>Love me or lose me<br>
Why would you abuse me<br>
I wish you would choose me<br>
Over those who bruise me<br><br>

I think you have lost your tact<br>
And if you don't clean up your act<br>
You won't ever get me back<br>
And I know you will feel the lack<br><br>

Love me or lose me<br>
The choice is yours<br>
If you don't change eventually<br>
You'll kiss the floor<br><br>

Why'd you have to be so nice <br>
Luring me in with good advice<br>
I didn't know the heavy price<br>
Now being without you will suffice<br><br>

Love me or lose me<br>
Stop trying to confuse me<br>
Letting your friends screw me<br>
Over isn't healthy<br><br>

I think you have lost your brain<br>
You make me feel fucking insane<br>
If you never ever change <br>
In my life you cannot remain<br><br>

Love me or lose me<br>
The choice is yours<br>
If you don't change eventually<br>
You'll kiss the floor<br><br>

Why'd you have to be so nice <br>
Luring me in with good advice<br>
I didn't know the heavy price<br>
Now being without you will suffice<br><br>

And I really don't want to ever lose you<br>
But I will if you leave me with no choice not to<br>
You're gonna regret <br>
The things that you said <br>
Living in fantasy land<br>
With your head in the sand<br><br>

Love me or lose me<br>
The choice is yours<br>
If you don't change eventually<br>
You'll kiss the floor<br><br>

Why'd you have to be so nice<br> 
Luring me in with good advice<br>
Now I know the heavy price<br>

	<h3 id="youruinedme">you ruined me</h3>
	<p>
You're my biggest regret<br>
You fucked up my head<br>
Now my mind is broken glass<br>
Wish I could change the past<br><br>

You opened up my scars<br>
And poured salt in the wound<br>
I can't give you the stars<br>
You sure gave me a tomb<br><br>

If I could go back<br>
I might switch the track<br>
Tell myself to run<br>
Don't fall for the fun<br><br>

I have nightmares about how you ruined me<br>
Oh you probably think it's fine cause you don't see<br>
The lacerations on my heart<br>
My scarlet eyes hid in the dark<br><br>

You fucked me up to hell and back<br>
Oh you made me insane and go on the attack<br>
The indentations on your guise<br>
The scarlet lines in both my eyes<br><br>

Made me the villain when I was beaten down<br>
Stared at the ceiling and wished that I'd just drown<br>
The pictures of us all together<br>
Now just make stormy weather<br><br>

I'm too god damn attached (too god damn attached)<br>
To wolves in sheep's clothing<br>
Even after they've attacked<br>
They induce self loathing<br><br>

If I could go back<br>
I would switch the track<br>
Tell myself to run<br>
Don't fall for the fun<br><br>

I have nightmares about how you ruined me<br>
Oh you probably think it's fine cause you don't see<br>
The lacerations on my heart<br>
My scarlet eyes hid in the dark<br><br>

You fucked me up to hell and back<br>
Oh you made me insane and go on the attack<br>
The indentations on your guise<br>
The scarlet lines in both my eyes<br><br>

I hope that clarity comes with time<br>
And I don't fall for another disguise<br>
To get back in I wouldn't pay a dime<br>
The marks you made on me should be a crime<br><br>

I find myself running back to your friends<br>
Cause they're too good for you<br>
They brought to life my many colors<br>
But then washed them all off too<br><br>

After all you've done<br>
You've had your fun<br>
You lied to them too<br>
Made my friends believe it's true<br><br>

I can't forgive<br>
I can't forget<br>
No I can't live<br>
When I'm this upset<br><br>

I have nightmares about how you ruined me<br>
Oh you probably think it's fine cause you don't see<br>
The lacerations on my heart<br>
My scarlet eyes hid in the dark<br>

You fucked me up to hell and back<br>
Oh you made me insane and go on the attack<br>
The indentations on your guise<br>
The scarlet lines in both my eyes<br><br>

I have nightmares about how you ruined me</p>

	<p>I'll keep loving you until you screw me over<br>
Then I'll resent you until the end of time<br>
I'll keep missing you when it turns to winter<br>
Then I'll remember why I said goodbye<br><br>

Scared<br>
I'm always so fucking scared<br>
Arachnids crawl up my walls<br>
My vision is impaired<br><br>

Don't be a stranger<br>
Don't be a stranger <br>
Don't be a stranger<br>
Don't be a stranger<br><br>

Every once-lit face is dark<br>
They eat away at my heart<br>
The memories suffocate me<br>
Until I can't begin to breathe<br><br>

The memories of you and me<br>
Are lined up like a firing squad<br>
And if you leave, oh if you leave<br>
They'll raise their guns and get me shot<br><br>

And if I don't see you again<br>
The memories inside my head<br>
Will swell and cry when I'm in bed<br>
Until my eyes have nothing left<br><br>

Scared<br>
I'm always so fucking scared<br>
Ghosts haunt me when I'm not asleep<br>
My vision is impaired<br><br>

Don't be a stranger<br>
Don't be a stranger <br>
Don't be a stranger<br>

And I <br>
Don't want to cry<br>
About people that I miss<br>
God, I just need a kiss<br><br>

To take<br>
It all away<br>
I'm tired <br>
Of people I know becoming strangers<br><br>

Don't be a stranger<br>
Don't be a stranger <br>
Don't be a stranger<br>
Don't be a stranger<br><br>

Every once-lit face is dark<br>
They eat away at my heart<br>
The memories suffocate me<br>
Until I can't begin to breathe<br><br>

Don't be a stranger</p>

	<p>You imply that the part of me<br>
That stands up for myself<br>
And defends me rightfully<br>
Is a demon that made me yell<br><br>

Don't you know that makes me feel crazy?<br>
And nor does it help<br>
Our camaraderie's getting hazy<br>
Makes me wanna belt<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Look in my eyes and know it's me<br>
I'm just expressing my feelings<br>
I just want everybody to see<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br><br>

I don't need your approval you see<br>
Or validation to soothe<br>
But I just thought you'd believe me<br>
And I'd have nothing to prove<br>
Yeah<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Look in my eyes and know it's me<br>
I'm just expressing my feelings<br>
I just want everybody to see<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br><br>

Don't you know I hid myself for years?<br>
They say "let it out" but once I do there's tears<br>
Why can't you just see?<br>
I shouldn't have to beg you to believe me<br>
What is it like to be believed<br>
The first time that you say something?<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Look in my eyes and know it's me<br>
I'm just expressing my feelings<br>
I just want everybody to see<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"</p>

	<p>you found me at my lowest<br>
on the floor at an open mic bar<br>
you said "are you ok?"<br>
as I sunk in tar<br><br>

pulling me out<br>
and sitting me down<br>
out with the others<br>
so I'd hear the sounds<br><br>

The truth is that I'm drowning <br>
and you are too <br>
but you gave me a reason<br>
to keep pushing through<br><br>

cause we're in the same boat<br>
trying to survive<br>
and your flame might be the reason<br>
that we made it out alive<br><br>

sitting there pondering <br>
who will go first?<br>
can't help but wonder<br>
when we'll die of thirst<br><br>

and I will die too <br>
if you leave me here<br>
I am too scared<br>
I can't bear the fear<br><br>

The truth is I'm drowning <br>
and you are too <br>
but I gave you a reason<br>
to keep pushing through<br>

cause we're in the same boat<br>
trying to survive<br>
and your flame might be the reason<br>
that we made it out alive<br><br>

and I know you're not perfect<br>
yeah I also skew<br>
It doesn't mean nobody<br>
should love you<br><br>

yeah we can improve <br>
if we really want to<br>
so let the flame burn bright<br>
inside of you<br><br>

The truth is I'm drowning <br>
and you are too <br>
but you gave me a reason<br>
to keep pushing through<br>

cause we're in the same boat<br>
trying to survive<br>
and your flame might be the reason<br>
that we made it out alive</p>
