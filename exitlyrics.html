	<p>On the "first date" he came to my house<br>
We watched a movie but not on the couch<br>
He stole my first kiss like he was a poser<br>
Then in a month it was pretty much over<br><br>

A text for a breakup, it gave me no closure<br><br>

Went to a park for a first and last date<br>
I showed up first and he showed up late<br>
We went on a hike nearby<br>
He talked the whole time<br><br>

He kissed me with tongue and then said goodbye<br><br>

New boy at a new park, and it was great<br>
Best I could've asked for, like it was fate<br>
First guy I said "I love you" to<br>
But 50 days gone, I had no clue<br><br>

He ghosted that summer, and colored me blue<br><br>

Like a morning fog, new boy blinded me<br>
Couple of red flags I chose not to see<br>
Loved him for 3 months and still love him now<br>
Trying to stay friends but I don't know how<br><br>

But I need him in my life, so I'll let myself drown<br>

	<p>Doing all the right things <br>
But people hate me anyways<br><br>

I can't stop holding my breath<br>
Panic attacks feel like death<br>
People say I shouldn't please<br>
but there's no cure for this disease<br><br>

Is this awkward?<br>
What do you think?<br>
Am I stupid?<br>
God I just wanna sink<br><br>

When I speak my mind<br>
It never goes well<br>
You become satan<br>
And I go to hell<br><br>

The devil's in the details<br>
People pleasers off the rails<br>
Doing all the right things <br>
But people hate me anyways<br><br>

When I decided to focus on my needs<br>
Stubborn assholes brought me to my knees<br>
I try to do the right things and not get hurt<br>
But still no one sees my hard ass effort<br><br>

Is this awkward?<br>
What do you think?<br>
Am I stupid?<br>
God I just wanna sink<br><br>

When I speak my mind<br>
It never goes well<br>
You become satan<br>
And I go to hell<br><br>

The devil's in the details<br>
People pleasers off the rails<br>
Doing all the right things <br>
But people hate me anyways<br><br>

Doing all the right things <br>
Doing all the right things <br>
Doing all the right things <br>
Doing all the right things <br>
Doing all the right things <br>
Doing all the right things <br>
Doing all the right things <br>
Doing all the right things <br><br>

People hate me anyways<br>
People hate me anyways<br>
People hate me anyways<br>
People hate me anyways<br>
People hate me anyways<br>
People hate me anyways<br>
People hate me anyways<br>
People hate me anyways<br><br>

Doing all the right things<br>
But people hate me anyways<br><br>

When I speak my mind<br>
It never goes well<br>
You become satan<br>
And I go to hell<br><br>

The devil's in the details<br>
People pleasers off the rails<br>
Doing all the right things <br>
But people hate me anyways</p>

	<p>Violet is my aura<br>
I'm sweet and kind to you<br>
Betrayal's the kind of horror<br>
That makes my blood burn blue<br><br>

With my luck, there's bound to be a fracture<br>
Cause everyone lets me down<br>
I'm the kind of person that ain't manufactured<br>
Another won't come around<br><br>

I'm your deadly nightshade<br>
I'm pretty and safe to touch<br>
But if you put me on a plate <br>
I'll poison you and hold a grudge<br><br>

I'm always ready to switch up on you<br>
I'm always planning what I will do<br>
If you betray me, I won't have mercy<br>
I don't take this lightly, I think about it nightly<br><br>

Indigo is my color<br>
I'm the one they forget in a rainbow<br>
Optimism is getting duller <br>
In society the bar is low<br><br>

With my luck, there's bound to be a fracture<br>
Cause everyone fucks me over<br>
I'm the kind of person that ain't manufactured<br>
Cause I'm as rare as a four leaf clover<br><br>

I'm your deadly nightshade<br>
I'm pretty and safe to touch<br>
But if you put me on a plate <br>
I'll poison you and hold a grudge<br><br>

I'm always ready to switch up on you<br>
I'm always planning what I will do<br>
If you betray me, I won't have mercy<br>
I don't take this lightly, I think about it nightly<br><br>

Wary wary, you should be<br>
If you're not careful I'll make you go crazy<br>
Scary, scary, I can be<br>
Please don't be someone I poison slowly<br><br>

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah<br><br>

I'm your deadly nightshade<br>
I'm pretty and safe to touch<br>
But if you put me on a plate<br> 
I'll poison you and hold a grudge<br><br>

I'm always ready to switch up on you<br>
I'm always planning what I will do<br>
If you betray me, I won't have mercy<br>
I don't take this lightly, I think about it nightly</p>

	<p>I was making a necklace<br>
That had your name on it<br>
I didn't think you'd let this<br>
Crush it into pieces<br><br>

I've talked to you for years<br>
Through smiles and through tears<br>
Now when I'm the most lonely <br>
(You're in the) list of ones who had once known me<br><br>

You broke the nexus<br>
between us<br>
We were hanging on a thread<br>
You know what I said<br><br>

We both cut some a bit<br>
But at least I tried to fix it<br>
Then you let it break us<br>
The breaking of our nexus<br><br>

Have you ever stopped texting someone first?<br>
And then realize they didn't care enough?<br>
Do they piss you off then act like you're the worst?<br>
Then you realize that they're maybe too rough<br><br>

The other years we're happy people<br>
But now our friendship is so feeble<br>
No more pride and no more tears<br>
Please just don't stick around here<br><br>

You broke the nexus<br>
between us<br>
We were hanging on a thread<br>
You know what I said<br><br>

We both cut some a bit<br>
But at least I tried to fix it<br>
Then you let it break us<br>
The breaking of our nexus<br><br>

You don't care about how you affect others<br>
Using people left and right, I better take cover<br>
You only think about yourself <br>
You only think about yourself <br>
You think only about yourself<br>
There's nobody else<br><br>

(You broke the nexus)<br>
(There's nobody else)</p>

	<p>Immature like they're new to middle school<br>
Insensitive like a sharp stone wall<br>
Lack empathy like sociopaths<br>
Tear you down then want you fucking back<br>
<br>
Boys don't like it when you fight back<br>
Boys call you sensitive then go on the attack<br>
From the smallest little thing you do<br>
Boys fucking suck and that is nothing new<br><br>

Boys don't like it when you speak your mind<br>
Good boys are diamonds—so hard to find<br>
From the core of the earth to the bright moon<br>
Boys fucking suck and that is nothing new<br><br>

Writing in a burning diary<br>
About boys fucking up everything<br>
Go to fucking therapy, realize you're wrong<br>
And then maybe you will understand this song<br><br>

Boys don't like it when you fight back<br>
Boys call you sensitive then go on the attack<br>
From the smallest little thing you do<br>
Boys fucking suck and that is nothing new<br><br>

Boys don't like it when you speak your mind<br>
Good boys are diamonds—so hard to find<br>
From the core of the earth to the bright moon<br>
Boys fucking suck and that is nothing new<br><br>
 
Of course not all of them are pieces of shit<br>
But call me the fuck up if you find one bitch<br>
This song is short like your attention span<br>
As long as you're this immature, you'll never be a man</p>

	<p>I walk by the crowds of people<br>
They say hi to each other<br>
So I lie when I'm asked "how are you?"<br>
By a teacher or my mother<br><br>

I don't want to die but I might as well be<br>
A corpse with robotic bones<br>
I know I have a single friend<br>
But I still feel alone<br><br>

Fragile, fragile me<br>
I'll never be truly free<br>
From the sickness you can't see<br>
This shit won't help I guarantee <br><br>

The darkest dread begins to loom<br>
When I'm alone and people pass<br>
Now when I'm in a crowded room<br>
I disappear like I'm made of glass<br><br>

Reading up on how to make friends<br>
Cause that's what everybody recommends<br>
Sitting by myself at the lunch table<br>
Thinking bout my social life like a fable<br><br>

It's not so easy to talk to humans<br>
All I do is turn up the music<br>
Maybe I'm not a fucking human<br>
I don't care about my contribution <br><br>

Fragile, fragile me<br>
I'll never be truly free<br>
From the sickness you can't see<br>
This shit won't help I guarantee <br><br>

The darkest dread begins to loom<br>
When I'm alone and people pass<br>
Now when I'm in a crowded room<br>
I disappear like I'm made of glass<br><br>

I'm a background character in my own story<br>
I'm someone everybody finds boring<br>
I sacrificed quantity for quality<br>
But realized most people treat me shitty<br><br>

I'm the least valued in the friend group<br>
I'm the most pushed aside and out of the loop<br>
I'm the least interesting at the hangout<br>
I'm the most ignored and least talked about<br><br>

Fragile, fragile me<br>
I'll never be truly free<br>
From the sickness you can't see<br>
This shit won't help I guarantee <br><br>

The darkest dread begins to loom<br>
When I'm alone and people pass<br>
Now when I'm in a crowded room<br>
I disappear like I'm made of glass</p>

	<p>It's times like these<br>
That I've got a disease<br>
That is terminal<br>
I'm mercurial <br><br>

Always on the brink<br>
Hard Ice on the rink<br>
I fell down<br>
I drowned<br><br>
 
I'm dying at 4am<br>
Please come help me again<br>
Or at least come say goodbye <br>
So I can say I tried<br><br>

The rink has melted<br>
So I felt it<br>
Then I fell in<br>
Wet clothing<br><br>

It weighed me down<br>
My mind so loud<br>
Then the whole town<br>
They let me down<br><br>

I'm dying at 4am<br>
Please come help me out again<br>
Or at least come say goodbye <br>
So I can say I tried<br><br>

Please<br>
Will you ease<br>
My pain?<br>
My brain?<br><br>

Please<br>
Will you end it<br>
My friend?<br>
The end</p>

	<p>You say im not the problem<br>
And I always agree<br>
But how could that be true<br>
After all those who left me<br><br>

You say that you haven't <br>
And even though that's true<br>
Soon you'll be the only one<br>
Who's stuck to me like glue<br><br>

A forest of people<br>
Relationships that died<br>
The trees are black and burnt<br>
With just a few alive<br><br>

Is it my fault? <br>
Is it my fault? <br>
You said all of my matches<br>
Have been locked inside a vault</p>

	<p>I love you<br>
You don't love me <br>
As much as I do<br>
Set me free<br><br>

The second<br>
Option<br>
In every <br>
Situation<br><br>

Nobody loves me as much as I love them<br><br>

Always just<br>
The unimportant friend<br>
My knife rusts<br>
But still I feel like shit in the end<br><br>

A friend<br>
Is hanging out<br>
With people
They barely know over me<br><br>

Nobody loves me as much as I love them<br><br>

Maybe I'll stop being clingy <br>
And give them their space<br>
Won't express the extent <br>
Of my love if it's a waste<br><br>

Nobody loves me as much as I love them<br>
It's simple as that, no need to pretend<br><br>


PART II: <br><br>
 
Nobody can satisfy me<br>
Are my standards too high? <br>
Or does everyone just suck? <br>
I may never know! <br><br>

Quit fucking disappointing me<br>
I loved you and you couldn't see<br>
I thought you cared for me<br>
Have you listened to "nightshade"? Well I guess we'll see <br><br>

Nobody loves me as much as I love them<br>
It's simple as that, no need to pretend<br>
I'm going crazy, this torture never ends<br>
Lie all you want, but I know that you'll miss this<br><br>

Think about someone else's feelings for a change<br>
Think about someone else's feelings for a change<br>
Think about someone else's feelings for a change<br>
I'd give you one more chance but people never change<br><br>

Nobody hates me as much as I hate them<br>
It's simple as that, no need to pretend<br>
I'm going crazy, this torture never ends<br>
Lie all you want, but I know that you'll miss this<br><br>
 
People never change<br>
People never change<br>
People never change no<br>
People never change<br><br>

People never change<br>
People never change<br>
People never change no<br>
People never change<br><br>

People never change<br>
People never change<br>
People never fucking change</p>

	<p>People will tell you to speak<br>
Then ignore you when you do<br>
They'll act like you're a freak<br>
Then act like they belong in a zoo<br><br>

They say "stand up for yourself"<br>
Then call you fucking sensitive<br>
They'll put you on the highest shelf<br>
Then ask why you're so negative<br><br>

Why's everybody a hypocrite?<br>
Abusive love, I don't give a shit<br>
What you are going through<br>
Cause I'm going through my own shit too<br><br>

People will ask you why<br>
Then get mad at the reason<br>
People will always lie<br>
In every goddamn season<br><br>

They say "just go make friends"<br>
Gee, why haven't I thought of that?<br>
They say "Oh he just tends<br>
To be a dickwad and a rat"<br><br>

Why's everybody a hypocrite?<br>
Abusive love, I don't give a shit<br>
What you are going through<br>
Cause I'm going through my own shit too<br><br>

They'll excuse the worst people<br>
Then ask what they did wrong <br>
They'll push you to your limit <br>
Then act like you were the villain all along <br>

Why's everybody a hypocrite?<br>
Abusive love, I don't give a shit<br>
What you are going through<br>
Cause I'm going through my own shit too<br><br>

This is what society has taught me<br>
Everyone's an asshole, wimp or hypocrite<br>
Of it all I can't ever be free<br>
Fuck you all, I wish I could just quit</p>

	<p>Love me or lose me<br>
Why would you abuse me<br>
I wish you would choose me<br>
Over those who bruise me<br><br>

I think you have lost your tact<br>
And if you don't clean up your act<br>
You won't ever get me back<br>
And I know you will feel the lack<br><br>

Love me or lose me<br>
The choice is yours<br>
If you don't change eventually<br>
You'll kiss the floor<br><br>

Why'd you have to be so nice <br>
Luring me in with good advice<br>
I didn't know the heavy price<br>
Now being without you will suffice<br><br>

Love me or lose me<br>
Stop trying to confuse me<br>
Letting your friends screw me<br>
Over isn't healthy<br><br>

I think you have lost your brain<br>
You make me feel fucking insane<br>
If you never ever change <br>
In my life you cannot remain<br><br>

Love me or lose me<br>
The choice is yours<br>
If you don't change eventually<br>
You'll kiss the floor<br><br>

Why'd you have to be so nice <br>
Luring me in with good advice<br>
I didn't know the heavy price<br>
Now being without you will suffice<br><br>

And I really don't want to ever lose you<br>
But I will if you leave me with no choice not to<br>
You're gonna regret <br>
The things that you said <br>
Living in fantasy land<br>
With your head in the sand<br><br>

Love me or lose me<br>
The choice is yours<br>
If you don't change eventually<br>
You'll kiss the floor<br><br>

Why'd you have to be so nice<br> 
Luring me in with good advice<br>

	<p>
You're my biggest regret<br>
You fucked up my head<br>
Now my mind is broken glass<br>
Wish I could change the past<br><br>

You opened up my scars<br>
And poured salt in the wound<br>
I can't give you the stars<br>
You sure gave me a tomb<br><br>

If I could go back<br>
I might switch the track<br>
Tell myself to run<br>
Don't fall for the fun<br><br>

I have nightmares about how you ruined me<br>
Oh you probably think it's fine cause you don't see<br>
The lacerations on my heart<br>
My scarlet eyes hid in the dark<br><br>

You fucked me up to hell and back<br>
Oh you made me insane and go on the attack<br>
The indentations on your guise<br>
The scarlet lines in both my eyes<br><br>

Made me the villain when I was beaten down<br>
Stared at the ceiling and wished that I'd just drown<br>
The pictures of us all together<br>
Now just make stormy weather<br><br>

I'm too god damn attached (too god damn attached)<br>
To wolves in sheep's clothing<br>
Even after they've attacked<br>
They induce self loathing<br><br>

If I could go back<br>
I would switch the track<br>
Tell myself to run<br>
Don't fall for the fun<br><br>

I have nightmares about how you ruined me<br>
Oh you probably think it's fine cause you don't see<br>
The lacerations on my heart<br>
My scarlet eyes hid in the dark<br><br>

You fucked me up to hell and back<br>
Oh you made me insane and go on the attack<br>
The indentations on your guise<br>
The scarlet lines in both my eyes<br><br>

I hope that clarity comes with time<br>
And I don't fall for another disguise<br>
To get back in I wouldn't pay a dime<br>
The marks you made on me should be a crime<br><br>

I find myself running back to your friends<br>
Cause they're too good for you<br>
They brought to life my many colors<br>
But then washed them all off too<br><br>

After all you've done<br>
You've had your fun<br>
You lied to them too<br>
Made my friends believe it's true<br><br>

I can't forgive<br>
I can't forget<br>
No I can't live<br>
When I'm this upset<br><br>

I have nightmares about how you ruined me<br>
Oh you probably think it's fine cause you don't see<br>
The lacerations on my heart<br>
My scarlet eyes hid in the dark<br>

You fucked me up to hell and back<br>
Oh you made me insane and go on the attack<br>
The indentations on your guise<br>
The scarlet lines in both my eyes<br><br>

I have nightmares about how you ruined me</p>

Then I'll resent you until the end of time<br>
I'll keep missing you when it turns to winter<br>
Then I'll remember why I said goodbye<br><br>

Scared<br>
I'm always so fucking scared<br>
Arachnids crawl up my walls<br>
My vision is impaired<br><br>

Don't be a stranger<br>
Don't be a stranger <br>
Don't be a stranger<br>
Don't be a stranger<br><br>

Every once-lit face is dark<br>
They eat away at my heart<br>
The memories suffocate me<br>
Until I can't begin to breathe<br><br>

The memories of you and me<br>
Are lined up like a firing squad<br>
And if you leave, oh if you leave<br>
They'll raise their guns and get me shot<br><br>

And if I don't see you again<br>
The memories inside my head<br>
Will swell and cry when I'm in bed<br>
Until my eyes have nothing left<br><br>

Scared<br>
I'm always so fucking scared<br>
Ghosts haunt me when I'm not asleep<br>
My vision is impaired<br><br>

Don't be a stranger<br>
Don't be a stranger <br>
Don't be a stranger<br>
Don't be a stranger<br><br>

Every once-lit face is dark<br>
They eat away at my heart<br>
The memories suffocate me<br>
Until I can't begin to breathe<br><br>

And I <br>
Don't want to cry<br>
About people that I miss<br>
God, I just need a kiss<br><br>

To take<br>
It all away<br>
I'm tired <br>
Of people I know becoming strangers<br><br>

Don't be a stranger<br>
Don't be a stranger <br>
Don't be a stranger<br>
Don't be a stranger<br><br>

Every once-lit face is dark<br>
They eat away at my heart<br>
The memories suffocate me<br>
Until I can't begin to breathe<br><br>

Don't be a stranger</p>

	<p>You imply that the part of me<br>
That stands up for myself<br>
And defends me rightfully<br>
Is a demon that made me yell<br><br>

Don't you know that makes me feel crazy?<br>
And nor does it help<br>
Our camaraderie's getting hazy<br>
Makes me wanna belt<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Look in my eyes and know it's me<br>
I'm just expressing my feelings<br>
I just want everybody to see<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br><br>

I don't need your approval you see<br>
Or validation to soothe<br>
But I just thought you'd believe me<br>
And I'd have nothing to prove<br>
Yeah<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Look in my eyes and know it's me<br>
I'm just expressing my feelings<br>
I just want everybody to see<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br><br>

Don't you know I hid myself for years?<br>
They say "let it out" but once I do there's tears<br>
Why can't you just see?<br>
I shouldn't have to beg you to believe me<br>
What is it like to be believed<br>
The first time that you say something?<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Look in my eyes and know it's me<br>
I'm just expressing my feelings<br>
I just want everybody to see<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br>
Nothing is wrong with these "demons"<br><br>

Nothing is wrong with these "demons"</p>

	<p>you found me at my lowest<br>
on the floor at an open mic bar<br>
you said "are you ok?"<br>
as I sunk in tar<br><br>

pulling me out<br>
and sitting me down<br>
out with the others<br>
so I'd hear the sounds<br><br>

The truth is that I'm drowning <br>
and you are too <br>
but you gave me a reason<br>
to keep pushing through<br><br>

cause we're in the same boat<br>
trying to survive<br>
and your flame might be the reason<br>
that we made it out alive<br><br>

sitting there pondering <br>
who will go first?<br>
can't help but wonder<br>
when we'll die of thirst<br><br>

and I will die too <br>
if you leave me here<br>
I am too scared<br>
I can't bear the fear<br><br>

The truth is I'm drowning <br>
and you are too <br>
but I gave you a reason<br>
to keep pushing through<br>

cause we're in the same boat<br>
trying to survive<br>
and your flame might be the reason<br>
that we made it out alive<br><br>

and I know you're not perfect<br>
yeah I also skew<br>
It doesn't mean nobody<br>
should love you<br><br>

yeah we can improve <br>
if we really want to<br>
so let the flame burn bright<br>
inside of you<br><br>

The truth is I'm drowning <br>
and you are too <br>
but you gave me a reason<br>
to keep pushing through<br>

cause we're in the same boat<br>
trying to survive<br>
and your flame might be the reason<br>
that we made it out alive</p>
