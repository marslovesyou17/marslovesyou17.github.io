	<h1>~ "perennials" Lyrics ~</h1>
	<br>
	<h3>perennials</h3>
	<p>Your towel's hanging near<br>
For when you'd shower here<br>
A reminder of what we shared<br>
I wonder if you even care<br>
Even though I saw you cry<br>
And I saw it in your eyes<br>
You care about me too<br>
But I never trust the truth<br><br>

Tell me you love me<br>
Say that you miss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and kiss me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and fix everything<br><br>

When I was your sweetheart<br>
I felt like we were pure art<br>
But now maybe we weren't<br>
Now I feel I've learned<br>
We always had trouble growing<br>
Through all of the weeds<br>
You said you wouldn't be going<br>
But I don't know where this leads<br><br>

Tell me you love me<br>
Say that you miss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and kiss me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and<br><br>

Tell me you miss me<br>
Say that you'll kiss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and love me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and fix everything<br><br>

The lightning and the rain came down<br>
On our flowers in this small town<br>
All the gifts on earth can't fix my heart<br>
But I still want nothing to tear us apart<br><br>

Tell me you love me<br>
Say that you miss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and kiss me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and<br><br>

Tell me you miss me<br>
Say that you'll kiss me<br>
I know you're thinking of me so<br>
Come back and love me<br>
Get your shit together<br>
Or you'll lose me forever<br>
Grow us back in spring <br>
Water our perennials and fix everything
