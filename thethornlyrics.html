	<h1>~ "the thorn" Lyrics ~</h1>
	<br>
	<h3>the thorn</h3>
	<p>Sometimes I think we could've had it all<br>
I rarely think about your lack of balls<br>
But when there's a moment that I just do<br>
I feel I could've made a life with you<br>
If you really were at all brave like me<br>
Our ship would have sailed beautifully<br>
Like a thorn it's stabbing, stabbing to me<br>
It's a painful reminder to me, see?<br><br>
 
I ignore the thorn in my side<br>
I try not to adorn our past life<br>
It could've not given us the blues<br>
But the one who broke my heart is you<br><br>

Trying not to get cut in the bushes <br>
Fucking crying face down in my cushions<br>
Blood is racing down my face and body<br>
I'm missing you at my birthday party<br>
Cause a year ago you spent the night here<br>
Kinda wish a guy like you would appear<br>
Puberty has been a fucking prison<br>
Wish I could lock problems in a prism<br><br>

I ignore the thorn in my side<br>
I try not to adorn our past life<br>
It could've not given us the blues<br>
But the one who broke my trust is you<br><br>

I ignore the thorn in my side<br>
I try not to adorn our past life<br>
It could've been our future too<br>
But the one who bailed on us is you
  </p>
