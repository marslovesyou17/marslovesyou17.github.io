	<p> By some serendipity I found you<br>
By some tranquility I love you<br>
By some astronomy you orbit<br>
By some love car you floored it<br>
By some ephemerality you found me<br>
By some convolution you found peace<br><br>

Every time you talk to me you say that I'm perfect<br>
You say what you wanna do to me is protect<br>
I wanna take you to see your favorite color of horizons<br>
You said the only thing you're settling for is diamonds<br><br>

Every time you talk to me you say that I'm perfect<br>
You say what you wanna do to me is protect<br>
I wanna take you to see your favorite color of horizons<br>

The only thing you're settling for is diamonds, diamonds<br>
The only thing you're settling for is diamonds, diamonds</p>

	<h3 id=“come_find_me”>come find me</h3>
	<p> You swore that you love me<br>
So prove it dear and find me<br>
I'm locked underground with no key<br>
But it's outside my cell where you can reach<br><br>

I'm crying on the floor of my room again<br>
I can't believe it's been five weeks since then<br>
The last time I saw you was so far back<br>
If it's much longer I'll have a heart attack<br>
I feel like you're not trying as hard as me<br>
To see one another can't you just see?<br>
I'll wait in this dungeon and when you're ready<br>
For once take the lead, and come find me<br><br>

I know that I love you<br>
More than you love me<br>
I'm destroyed when you're gone<br>
You only seem withdrawn<br>
You ask me not to leave<br>
But you've been away for ages<br>
I'm just a dog left in a hot car<br>
While the heat opens up old scars<br><br>

I'm crying on the floor of my room again<br>
I can't believe it's been five weeks since then<br>
The last time I saw you was so far back<br>
If it's much longer I'll have a heart attack<br>
I feel like you're not trying as hard as me<br>
To see one another can't you just see?<br>
I'll wait in this dungeon and when you're ready<br>
For once take the lead, and come find me<br><br>

I'm starving for you<br>
I don't want you to rue<br>
How you don't have a clue<br>
Despite what I say and do<br>
I'm trapped and dying<br>
These tears aren't lying<br>
I once was flying<br>
Right now I'm crying<br><br>

I'm screaming at a padded wall<br>
You can't hear me, not at all<br>
Throwing the phone I wait for your call<br>
But I feel like all that you do is stall<br>
I try to be patient, I try to be kind<br>
But that's only got me to lose my mind<br>
I give you love, but you don't give me mine<br>
Do you still love me? Please give me a sign<br><br>

I'm crying on the floor of my room again<br>
I can't believe it's been five weeks since then<br>
I'll wait in this dungeon and when you're ready<br>
For once take the lead, and come find me</p>

	<h3 id="portrait of us">portrait of us</h3>
	<p>I drew a portrait of us<br>
Because in you I had trust<br>
I gave it to you as a birthday present<br>
Now looking at the portrait ain't so pleasant<br><br>

The arm around my side<br>
Now looks like a cell bar<br>
I got stockholm and cried<br>
Left me with tender scars<br><br>

The portrait of us<br>
The idea of love<br>
The euphoric luck<br>
The way you fucked up<br>
The portrait of us<br><br>

The sides of the lines, trying to kill time<br>
Color in the eyes when the boy was mine<br>
Never done something so sweet<br>
For someone I never saw on my street<br><br>

The arm around my side<br>
Now looks like a cell bar<br>
I got stockholm and cried<br>
Left me with tender scars<br><br>

The portrait of us<br>
The idea of love<br>
The euphoric luck<br>
The way you fucked up<br>
The portrait of us<br><br>

I drew a portrait of us<br>
Because in you I had trust<br>
I gave it to you as a birthday present<br>

	<h3 id="a_fucking_tattoo">a fucking tattoo</h3>
	<p> You always liked my hair in a ponytail<br>
So I'll wear one as I hope it brings you back<br>
I always thought you were a fairytale<br>
But for what I need you have a lack<br><br>

Your nose must miss your face<br>
Cause I sure miss your trace<br>
You won't text, call, or even be here<br>
But you'll have a fuckin' thousand beers<br><br>

You don't have time to be with me<br>
You say it'll happen eventually<br>
But you had the time to get a fucking tattoo<br>
It's your damn game and you're gonna lose<br><br>

I thought you were different<br>
So I posted you and I<br>
I still have your hoodie here<br>
So I'll wear it as I cry<br><br>

I let you sleep inside my bed<br>
I let you sleep inside my head<br>
You have infected my mind<br>
I really thought you were kind<br><br>

Your nose must miss your face<br>
Cause I sure miss your trace<br>
You won't text, call, or even be here<br>
But you'll have a fuckin' thousand beers<br><br>

You don't have time to be with me<br>
You say it'll happen eventually<br>
But you had the time to get a fucking tattoo<br>
It's your damn game and you're gonna lose<br><br>

I asked if you still love me<br>
If you still want us to be<br>
You said "why else would I still be here?"<br>
I said"you aren't here!" hence my fear<br><br>

I thought it would take a few years at least<br>
For us to be torn apart<br>
But it seems it only took a few months<br>
For you to break my heart<br><br>

Your nose must miss your face<br>
Cause I sure miss your trace<br>
You won't text, call, or even be here<br>
But you'll have a fuckin' thousand beers<br><br>

You don't have time to be with me<br>
You say it'll happen eventually<br>
But you had the time to get a fucking tattoo<br>
It's your damn game and you're gonna lose

	<p> The love letters you wrote<br>
Look now like a joke<br>
I tore them all up<br>
Because your actions spoke<br>
Imagining your face happy<br>
When you'd open up your gift from me<br>
What I got for your birthday<br>
But now you'll never get to see<br><br>

The way you looked at me<br>
In the shower lovingly<br>
I knew you loved me so<br>
Now out the door you go<br>
Said it's hard to lose your love<br>
But I didn't feel I was enough<br>
You ghosted me somehow<br>
I'm going to haunt you now<br><br>

I drew us together<br>
Spent weeks on paper<br>
A beautiful show how I felt for you<br>
Then it fell like a feather<br>
Your hand holding it<br>
Became transparent<br>
Became an inconnu<br>
But I still love you<br><br>

The way you looked at me<br>
In the shower lovingly<br>
I knew you loved me so<br>
Now out the door you go<br>
Said it's hard to lose your love<br>
But I didn't feel I was enough<br>
You ghosted me somehow<br>
I'm going to haunt you now<br><br>

You'll see my face in magazines<br>
You'll hear my voice in movie screens<br>
My songs will creep within your feed<br>
Make you regret that vicious deed<br>
When you smell perfume you'll think of me<br>
You'll remember I still have your hoodie<br>
You never got your gift from me<br>
It's been sitting in my room for weeks<br>
You've got my pride and dignity<br>
You stole those two away from me<br>
I can't stop loathing how you set me free<br>
But the thought of me will be a disease<br><br>

The way you looked at me<br>
In the shower lovingly<br>
I knew you loved me so<br>
Now out the door you go<br>
Said it's hard to lose your love<br>
But I didn't feel I was enough<br>
You ghosted me somehow<br>
I'm going to haunt you now</p>

	<p> I been lonely<br>
I am mostly<br>
Over you already<br>
I'm a little petty<br><br>

But you weren't around for fifty days before you ghosted me<br>
So I'll dance around to"Good Luck, Babe!" because I feel relieved<br><br>

I'm not sad seeing pics<br>
Just pissed I dated a dick<br>
My friend told me I'm over it<br>
You fumbled, I'm the shit<br>
You always hated pop songs<br>
And I always hated music snobs<br>
You didn't think about the cost<br>
Cause this? It's your loss!<br><br>

Double A dick<br>
Not my first pick<br>
Couldn't get you off<br>
Maybe it's your small-<br><br>

My therapist said you're a liar and a player<br>
You act all tortured but you're a betrayer<br>
You said you're a devil, now I agree<br>
Now no one's gonna like you, I guarantee<br><br>

	<p> You had dreams about fucking me<br>
Now I have dreams about you yelling at me<br>
I'm tired of this grieving<br>
It makes me start seething<br>
But I want to be loved badly<br>
And men keep fucking up sadly<br>
I wish I didn't care<br>
Hurt me? Don't you dare<br><br>

My blood runs cold<br>
Cause this is getting old<br>
Empathy is getting hard<br>
Cause every guy I meet has theirs behind bars<br><br>

You had dreams about fucking me<br>
Now I have dreams about you yelling at me<br>
I lost counterfeit treasure<br>
It gives me no pleasure<br>
To say you were the love of my life<br>
I thought with you I'd spend my time<br>
For years and years at least<br>
But you gave me the least<br><br>

My blood runs cold<br>
Cause this is getting old<br>
Empathy is getting hard<br>
Cause every guy I meet has theirs behind bars<br><br>

To find a guy who's hot and kind<br>
Is rare to find, they just lie and whine<br>
Until it dies, and you have to find<br>
Another guy to fill the void in your life<br><br>

My blood runs cold<br>
Cause this is getting old<br>
Empathy is getting hard<br>
Cause every guy I meet has theirs behind bars</p>

	<p> Dear, the last jerk I dated<br>
Loving you was overrated<br>
Why it ended, I hope you know<br>
XOXO, you had to go<br>

I want some lips on mine<br>
It's been a long long time<br>
I want someone to touch me!<br>
And no, not just sexually<br><br>

I'm not desperate, just got a craving<br>
I just want a guy not prone to caving<br><br>

My heart beats rapid<br>
Thinking bout O's and X's<br>
A kiss is never vapid<br>
Baby give me that nexus<br>

X like a kiss, not the one you miss<br>
O like a hug, not the hole he dug<br>
M-A-K-E-O-U-T<br>
Get over here and make out with me!<br><br>

I'm craving a guy taller than me<br>
To hide me in his arms, make me giggly<br>
I don't give a fuck about my exes now<br>
Got taste for a new boy, take me down<br>

I've got a predilection for being loved<br>
And for that predicament I shouldn't be judged<br>
I know when I'm complimented, I just scoff<br>
But let me come over, babe, and get you off<br><br>

I'm not desperate, just got a craving<br>
I just want a guy not prone to caving<br><br>

My heart beats rapid<br>
Thinking bout O's and X's<br>

	<p> We're a candle in a storm<br>
A buoy underwater<br>
It's got me feeling worn<br>
Embellishes the harbor<br>
But we can't get there<br>
Cause I'm out at sea<br>
I don't trust anyone<br>
To come save me<br><br>

Quit lying<br>
Bout how you're gonna love me forever<br>
Cause it's just turning out to be never<br>
Quit lying<br>
Bout how you're gonna love me forever<br>
And how you'll never leave<br>
But you leave me in debris<br><br>

I'm dying<br>
Cause this shit lasts for never<br>
Just give bad vibes from the start<br>
Then you will not break my heart<br>
It feels like every guy<br>
Just uses me for sex<br>
To get their fill of it<br>
And leave me a mess<br><br>

I'm tired<br>
I'm tired<br>
I'm tired<br>
I'm tired of it<br><br>

	<h3 id="yumlc">you used me like cocaine (and i let it happen)</h3>
	<p>I missed you to the furthest star and back<br>
And you gave me three too many heart attacks<br>
You were the salt of my earth<br>
A wonderful curse<br><br>

Told me I'm a diamond<br>
Then broke me down to snow<br>
You did me good then did me dirty<br>
Then threw me out so slow<br><br>

Fuck your antics, fuck your music<br>
Fuck the way you made yourself intrinsic<br>
To me<br>
To me<br>
They say fine art comes with a price<br>
But I gave myself to you cause you were counterfeit"nice"<br>
To me<br>
To me<br><br>

Told me I'm a diamond<br>
Then broke me down to snow<br>
You did me good then did me dirty<br>
Then threw me out so slow<br><br>

If you're a drug I'm having withdrawals<br>
I'm a kid separated from their dolls<br>
If you're sugar I'm having a crash<br>
Each day without you is like a lash<br>
If you're sobriety I am wasted<br>
My texts sounded copied and pasted<br>
If you're the ocean I'm landlocked<br>
If you were behind a door, I wish I never knocked<br><br>

Told me I'm a diamond<br>
Then broke me down to snow<br>
You did me good then did me dirty<br>
Then threw me out so slow<br><br>

You used me like cocaine<br>
And I let it happen to me<br>
Now you're feeling pain<br>
Now you'll never be free</p>

	<h3 id="deathgrip">death grip</h3>
	<p> You held my hand to your chest in the car<br>
Now I'm crying in the grocery store parking lot<br>
My head in your lap<br>
Talking about the people who hurt me<br>
Now you're one of them sadly<br><br>

Take the pain of knowing<br>
We could've worked out great<br>
Take the pain of working<br>
To fix our titanic's fate<br>
Take the memories from me<br>
I'm trapped beneath the cold debris<br>
My death grip<br>
Our sinking ship<br><br>

Us cuddling and watching movies<br>
The night of my birthday<br>
You self fulfilling prophecy of a boy<br>
Never said what I needed you to say<br>
You'd swallow me every night<br>
Said you like to<br>
You then left me with nothing<br>
What could I do?<br><br>

Take the pain of knowing<br>
We could've worked out great<br>
Take the pain of working<br>
To fix our titanic's fate<br>
Take the memories from me<br>
I'm trapped beneath the cold debris<br>
My death grip<br>
Our sinking ship<br><br>

I still place my right hand on my left cheek<br>
Imagining my hand is yours<br>
I still roll over in my bed alone to see<br>
Your ghost looking back reassured<br>
But loving you isn't loving me (Drowning, drowning)<br>
You tortured me so easily (In my dreams you're shouting)<br>
Turns out you were my tattoo (Drowning, drowning)<br>
That I hope can be removed (In my dreams you're shouting)<br><br>

Take away the pain of knowing<br>
We could've worked out great<br>
Take away the pain of working<br>
To fix our titanic's fate<br>
Take the memories from me<br>
I'm trapped beneath the cold debris<br>
My death grip<br>
Our sinking ship<br><br>

	<p>
At the gloaming<br>
I stayed outside home just roaming<br>
At the campsite<br>
Somebody convinced me life was alright<br>
But the bottle<br>
Haunts me from wherever I coddle<br>
And the dull knife<br>
In my mind and thoughts remains rife<br><br>

What I thought was eudaemonic<br>
Turned out to be demonic<br>
But I begged and prayed<br>
I'm not even of that faith<br>
What I thought was forever<br>
Turned out to be never<br>
But I slammed the door<br>
Karma came back and she wants more<br>
Even though all my life<br>
I try to do things right<br>
I try to be a saint<br>
But god said "no, no the fuck you ain't"<br>
The doctor's diagnosis was the worst<br>
They told me I just might be cursed<br><br>

I guess I'm not unlucky<br>
Middle class life and endless hobbies<br>
But I'm losing the game<br>
I'll end up a sad artist with no money to my name<br><br>

What I thought was eudaemonic<br>
Turned out to be demonic<br>
But I begged and prayed<br>
I'm not even of that faith<br>
What I thought was forever<br>
Turned out to be never<br>
But I slammed the door<br>
Karma came back and she wants more<br>
Even though all my life<br>
I try to do things right<br>
I try to be a saint<br>
But god said "no, no the fuck you ain't"<br>
The doctor's diagnosis was the worst<br>
They told me I just might be cursed<br><br>

If there's a god<br>
They must hate me<br>
And so I clawed<br>
At the cage to be free<br>
Crying in the bathtub<br>
Wishing for a true love<br>
On the porch at 1am<br>
Thinking to myself "goddamn"<br><br>

They think I'm going to hell<br>
I think I wanna scream and yell<br>
I'm a self fulfilling prophecy<br>
I used to wanna end me<br>
What did it to me?<br>
The hell town or the Vatican?<br>
To whom do I plead?<br>
God or Satan?<br><br>

But what I thought was eudaemonic<br>
Turned out to be demonic<br>
But I begged and prayed<br>
I'm not even of that faith<br>
What I thought was forever<br>
Turned out to be never<br>
But I slammed the door<br>
Karma came back and she wants more<br>
Even though all my life<br>
I try to do things right<br>
I try to be a saint<br>
But god said "no, no the fuck you ain't"<br>
The doctor's diagnosis was the worst<br>
They told me I just might be cursed </p>

	<p> You're a constant for me<br>
I'm confident you won't disappear<br>
Like I know the moon will be<br>
Showing up every night so clear<br><br>

I feel so lucky to have you<br>
Full, crescent, or a half moon<br>
We could joke all damn night<br>
And we're so in sync we never fight<br>
Talking to you makes my day<br>
I'll never go away<br>
Talking to you makes my night<br>
Lets me know it'll be alright<br><br>

You are my best friend<br>
You listen to my songs so often<br>
I hope it's now till the end<br>
You make my anxieties soften<br><br>

I feel so lucky to have you<br>
Full, crescent, or a half moon<br>
We could joke all damn night<br>
And we're so in sync we never fight<br>
Talking to you makes my day<br>
I'll never go away<br>
Talking to you makes my night<br>
Lets me know it'll be alright<br><br>

You shine so bright<br>
In the dark<br>
Every single night<br>
It travels far<br>
I'm your number one fan<br>
You're mine too<br>
I don't need a dumb man<br>
If I have you<br><br>

I feel so lucky to have you<br>
Full, crescent, or a half moon<br>
We could joke all damn night<br>
And we're so in sync we never fight<br>
Talking to you makes my day<br>
I'll never go away<br>
Talking to you makes my night<br>
Lets me know it'll be alright </p>

	<p>I don't miss you<br>
I miss being loved<br>
I don't miss you<br>
I miss getting hugged<br><br>

I don't miss you<br>
I miss being happy<br>
I don't miss you<br>
I miss getting sappy<br><br>

I don't miss you<br>
I miss being missed<br>
I don't miss you<br>
I miss getting kissed<br><br>

I don't miss you<br>
I miss being held<br>
I don't miss you<br>
I miss doing well<br><br>

I don't miss you anymore<br>
But I hope you're doing well<br>
I don't miss you anymore<br>
Cause loving you was hell</p>
